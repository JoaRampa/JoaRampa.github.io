  <div class="about">
    <p>I'm a developer passionate about creating accessible content that combines intuitive design with optimal performance. My favorite work lies at the intersection of application design and structural development.</p> 
    <p>Currently, I am a recent graduate as a University Programming Technician at UTN Argentina. I have studied and applied concepts such as database normalization, OOP, classes, inheritance, interfaces, constructors, and API calls.</p> 
    <p>Most frequently used programming languages and libraries: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js 3, Express.js, SQL, MySQL, and C#. The use of these technologies, including back-end, server-side, and user-side application development, makes me consider myself a full-stack developer.</p> 
    <p>I am an enthusiastic developer looking for my first experience within a company, working with an experienced team and technologies from which I can continue to learn constantly along the way.</p>
